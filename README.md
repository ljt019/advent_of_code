# Advent of Code Solutions ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) repository! This project contains my personal solutions to the annual programming puzzles presented each December.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual set of holiday-themed programming challenges created by Eric Wastl, running each December. It features daily puzzles that increase in difficulty and cover a variety of programming concepts. It's a fun way to test your skills and learn something new every day during the holiday season.

## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized in folders named `YYYY` and within `dayXX/`, each containing the solutions for that years/days challenges.
